"""Contains definitions for the preactivation form of Residual Networks.
Residual networks (ResNets) were originally proposed in:
[1] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
    Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. arXiv:1512.03385
The full preactivation 'v2' ResNet variant implemented in this module was
introduced by:
[2] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
    Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks. arXiv: 1603.05027
The key difference of the full preactivation 'v2' variant compared to the
'v1' variant in [1] is the use of batch normalization before every weight layer.
Typical use:
   from tensorflow.contrib.slim.nets import resnet_v2
ResNet-101 for image classification into 1000 classes:
   # inputs has shape [batch, 224, 224, 3]
   with slim.arg_scope(resnet_v2.resnet_arg_scope()):
      net, end_points = resnet_v2.resnet_v2_101(inputs, 1000, is_training=False)
ResNet-101 for semantic segmentation into 21 classes:
   # inputs has shape [batch, 513, 513, 3]
   with slim.arg_scope(resnet_v2.resnet_arg_scope()):
      net, end_points = resnet_v2.resnet_v2_101(inputs,
                                                21,
                                                is_training=False,
                                                global_pool=False,
                                                output_stride=16)
